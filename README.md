# Programming
Very First Repository
Hello, I am new to GitHub and don't entirely understand what I am doing yet. I figured I would add this program I am working on in case
people who see it would like to give friendly advice or ideas to make it better. I am relatively new to programming and I work in C++.
I have made a few other basic programs and I have a decent grasp of the most common features of programming, but I still have much to learn.
